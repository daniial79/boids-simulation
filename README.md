# boids-simulation
this repository will maintain a simple project that I implemented by ebiten lib in Go with purpose of learning concurrency in this language. the main idea is simulating boids (android + bird) movement in 2 dimensions where each boid will be controlled by a thread and this flock of boids will communicate with each other in soft and smooth way
